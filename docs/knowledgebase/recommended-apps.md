# smartmontools

## Installation
`sudo apt-get install smartmontools`

## Description
âœ¦ Based on the search results, here's a summary of the reliability of smartmontools:

   * How long it has existed: The smartmontools project has a long and stable history. It was first
     released in October 2002 and has been continuously developed and maintained for over two
     decades, with new versions being released regularly.

   * Who recommends it: It is a standard and widely recommended tool for drive monitoring in the IT
     industry. It's used by:
       * System administrators and IT professionals to monitor servers and critical systems.
       * Major Linux distributions (like Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora) include it as a standard
         package.
       * Tech-savvy home users for proactive monitoring of their personal computers.
       * It also serves as the backend for several graphical disk health monitoring tools.

   * Reliability: smartmontools itself is considered very reliable. It accurately reports the
     S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) data that your drive's
     firmware provides. The reliability of the predictions depends on how well the drive's
     manufacturer has implemented S.M.A.R.T., but the tool itself is a trusted way to access this
     data. It is an essential tool for proactive drive maintenance and identifying potential issues
     before they lead to data loss.

  In short, it is a very mature, widely used, and trusted tool for monitoring drive health.


# Jetson-stats

## Usage
`jtop`

## Installation
`sudo -H pip3 install -U jetson-stats`

## Description


### Owner & Reliability

* **Owner:** The project is created and primarily maintained by [Raffaello Bonghi](https://github.com/rbonghi). He is a robotics engineer with a Ph.D., has a history of working at NVIDIA in AI & Robotics, and is highly active in the Jetson and ROS communities. This isn't some anonymous package; the author is a known and credible expert in this specific field.
* **Source:** The code is open-source and hosted on GitHub: [github.com/rbonghi/jetson_stats](https://github.com/rbonghi/jetson_stats).
* **Reliability:** This package is the de-facto standard for monitoring Jetson devices. It's even featured on NVIDIA's own developer blog. The GitHub repository is active, with over 2,400 stars, indicating widespread use and community trust.
* **Weakness:** The project's core weakness is its reliance on a single primary developer. While Raffaello is very active, if he were to stop maintaining it, the project could stagnate. This is a common risk with many open-source tools.

### Safety

This is where you need to be critical.

1.  **The `sudo` Problem:** You are installing this with `sudo -H pip3`. This gives the installation script root privileges. You're fundamentally trusting the developer (Raffaello Bonghi) and the Python Package Index (PyPI) that the code doesn't contain anything malicious.
2.  **Why `sudo` is Needed:** The tool requires elevated permissions to run because it needs to access low-level system files in locations like `/sys/devices/` to read real-time data about CPU/GPU frequency, temperature sensors, and power consumption. A standard user account can't access this information.
3.  **Code Auditing:** The biggest safety feature is that it's open-source. A security-conscious user can, and should, inspect the source code on GitHub *before* installing to verify what the scripts are doing. Most people don't, they simply trust the project's reputation.
4.  **PyPI as a Source:** While PyPI is the standard repository for Python packages, it has been a target for malicious actors who upload packages with names similar to popular ones (typosquatting) or inject bad code into otherwise legitimate packages. There are no known security vulnerabilities for `jetson-stats` itself, but the platform risk always exists.

---

**Verdict:**

The `jetson-stats` package is highly reliable and is created by a reputable owner within the NVIDIA Jetson ecosystem. It's as safe as a widely used, open-source tool can be. However, the requirement of `sudo` for installation and operation means you are explicitly granting it the highest level of access to your system. You are trusting the author's code completely.
